<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

It also offers a "search" feature where users can search for an artist name, album name, or track name, and the results are displayed inside the app.</p>
<p>BarRemote does not collect or store any personal data. Communication with the Spotify app is done by sending commands such as "play next track", "play previous track", "pause playback", "start playback", "set shuffle on", etc.
</br> The information used for the search feature is send to the Spotify Web API, in order to provide the results of the search. No user identifiable information is send to the Spotify service with these requests. Only the search text is send to the Spotify APIs.
